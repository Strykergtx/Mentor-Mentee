How to use~

After cloning, cd to the project folder and in cmd or vscode terminal and do `npm install`. This downloads all dependencies for ReactJS, then do `npm start` to start the ReactJS server,

Now open another cmd, cd to project folder, cd into server folder and type `npm install`. This downloads all dependencies for NodeJS. Now do `npm start` to start the NodeJS server.

Now you have to install redis if you haven't. To do this, go to `https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads` and install latest version, then open `redis-server` to run the redis server. This is needed to cache the data which is requested. Without this your application will be slow.
